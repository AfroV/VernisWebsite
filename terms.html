            <h2>1. About Us (Om oss)</h2>
            <p>Vernis is operated by 25.time AS, org.nr. 915 890 423, registered in Norway.</p>
            <p>Email: <a href="mailto:afrovikingnft@gmail.com">afrovikingnft@gmail.com</a></p>

            <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Vernis NFT"</strong> — A signed, numbered Ethereum-based non-fungible token. Each edition is uniquely numbered and recorded on-chain.</li>
                <li><strong>"Preservation Kit"</strong> — A set of individually CE-marked components and a custom enclosure, shipped to the NFT holder upon claiming. The kit includes: Raspberry Pi 5, 4" IPS display, 128GB storage with pre-loaded software, PETG enclosure, power supply, and assembly guide.</li>
                <li><strong>"Claiming" / "Redemption"</strong> — The process of burning the Vernis NFT to receive the Preservation Kit.</li>
                <li><strong>"Unclaimed NFT"</strong> — A Vernis NFT that has not been burned/redeemed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. What You Are Purchasing</h2>
            <p>When you mint a Vernis NFT, you are purchasing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A signed, numbered digital collectible (NFT) on Ethereum.</li>
                <li>The right to claim one (1) Vernis Preservation Kit by burning the NFT.</li>
                <li>The right to trade the unclaimed NFT on secondary markets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The NFT is the primary product — a collectible digital artwork. The Preservation Kit is provided as a benefit to NFT holders. The NFT does not constitute ownership of any intellectual property, company shares, or future revenue.</p>

            <h2>3a. Nature of the Preservation Kit</h2>
            <p>The Preservation Kit is a <strong>component kit</strong>, not an assembled electronic product. It contains individually CE-marked components (Raspberry Pi 5, display, power supply) alongside a passive PETG enclosure and assembly instructions. The buyer assembles the kit themselves.</p>
            <p>Each electronic component carries its original manufacturer's CE marking and warranty. Vernis does not manufacture, modify, or assemble these electronic components. The pre-loaded software on the SD card is open-source and provided "as is."</p>

            <h2>4. Pricing and Payment</h2>
            <p>The price is denominated in ETH (Ethereum). Any fiat currency estimates shown on the website are approximate and for reference only.</p>
            <p>All blockchain transaction fees (gas fees) are the responsibility of the buyer.</p>
            <p>Norwegian VAT (MVA) at the applicable rate is included where required by law. For cross-border sales, local tax obligations may apply to the buyer.</p>

            <h2>5. NFT Claim and Kit Delivery</h2>
            <p><strong>Claiming process:</strong> To receive the Preservation Kit, you must burn your Vernis NFT through the official Vernis website. Upon burning, you will be asked to provide shipping details.</p>
            <p><strong>Claim period:</strong> NFTs must be claimed within 12 months of mint date. After this period, we reserve the right to discontinue fulfillment, though we will make reasonable efforts to honor late claims.</p>
            <p><strong>Delivery:</strong> Kits are shipped from Norway via tracked shipping. Estimated delivery times:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Norway: 2–5 business days</li>
                <li>EEA/Europe: 5–10 business days</li>
                <li>USA/Canada: 7–14 business days</li>
                <li>Rest of world: 10–21 business days</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Shipping cost:</strong> Shipping and handling is paid by the claimer. The shipping fee will be calculated and communicated before you confirm your claim. You may choose not to proceed if the shipping cost is unacceptable.</p>
            <p><strong>Customs and import duties:</strong> For deliveries outside Norway, any customs duties, import taxes, or local VAT charged by the destination country are the sole responsibility of the buyer. These charges are outside our control and vary by country.</p>
            <p><strong>Returns address:</strong> If you need to return a kit (see section 6), returns must be sent to our business address listed in section 1. Do not send returns without first contacting us at <a href="mailto:afrovikingnft@gmail.com">afrovikingnft@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>6. Right of Withdrawal (Angrerett)</h2>
            <p>Under the Norwegian Consumer Purchases Act (angrerettloven), you have a 14-day right of withdrawal.</p>
            <p><strong>For the NFT mint:</strong> By minting the NFT, you consent to immediate delivery of digital content (the NFT token). In accordance with angrerettloven &sect; 22(m), you acknowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal for the digital content once the NFT has been delivered to your wallet.</p>
            <p><strong>For the Preservation Kit:</strong> The 14-day withdrawal period begins when you receive the kit. To exercise this right, contact us at <a href="mailto:afrovikingnft@gmail.com">afrovikingnft@gmail.com</a> with your order details. All components must be returned unused and in their original condition. Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the buyer.</p>

            <h2>7. Warranty and Defects (Reklamasjon)</h2>
            <p>Under the Norwegian Consumer Purchases Act (forbrukerkjøpsloven), you have a right to complain about defects for up to 2 years after receiving the kit (5 years for defects related to durability).</p>
            <p>The Preservation Kit contains individually CE-marked components from third-party manufacturers (Raspberry Pi Foundation, etc.). Each component is covered by its respective manufacturer's warranty. If a component arrives defective, we will replace the defective component in accordance with Norwegian consumer law.</p>
            <p>The custom PETG enclosure is manufactured by us. Defects in the enclosure will be handled directly.</p>
            <p>The software is open-source and provided "as is." Software issues are not covered by warranty, but we will make reasonable efforts to provide updates and support.</p>
            <p><strong>Warranty shipping:</strong> For valid warranty claims within the EEA, we cover the cost of return shipping. For warranty claims outside the EEA, the buyer is responsible for return shipping costs. In both cases, replacement components will be shipped to you at no charge.</p>
            <p><strong>Assembly disclaimer:</strong> The kit requires user assembly. Damage caused during or after assembly by the buyer is not covered under warranty.</p>

            <h2>8. Open Source Software</h2>
            <p>The Vernis software is open-source. The source code is publicly available and licensed under its respective open-source license. You are free to modify, update, and maintain the software independently.</p>
            <p>Even if Vernis ceases operations, the assembled kit will continue to function as a standalone unit.</p>

            <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Vernis is not responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of cryptocurrency or NFTs due to user error, wallet compromise, or blockchain issues.</li>
                <li>Fluctuations in ETH value or NFT secondary market prices.</li>
                <li>Third-party IPFS gateway availability (Vernis provides local backup specifically to mitigate this).</li>
                <li>Any loss arising from the use of decentralized technologies beyond our control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Vernis brand, logo, website design, and product design are the property of the company identified in section 1. The open-source software components are governed by their respective licenses.</p>
            <p>Purchasing a Vernis NFT does not grant any rights to the Vernis brand or intellectual property beyond the right to claim the Preservation Kit.</p>

            <h2>11. Secondary Market Sales</h2>
            <p>Unclaimed Vernis NFTs may be traded on secondary markets. The claim right transfers with the NFT. We are not responsible for secondary market transactions, pricing, or disputes between buyers and sellers on third-party platforms.</p>

            <h2>12. Governing Law and Disputes (Lovvalg og tvister)</h2>
            <p>These terms are governed by Norwegian law. Any disputes will be resolved through the Norwegian Consumer Disputes Commission (Forbrukertvistutvalget) or the ordinary Norwegian courts, in accordance with the Consumer Disputes Act (forbrukerklageloven).</p>
            <p>For complaints, contact us at <a href="mailto:afrovikingnft@gmail.com">afrovikingnft@gmail.com</a>. If we cannot resolve your complaint, you may file a case with <a href="https://www.forbrukertilsynet.no" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbrukertilsynet</a> (the Norwegian Consumer Authority).</p>

            <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the website and, where possible, to NFT holders directly. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
