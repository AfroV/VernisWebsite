    I should spesify claiming time? so i dont have to hold storage. also, what do i do about shipping in case some lieve way off. and it becomes expensive to ship there. Can you serch the web on price for verified shipping from norwat to different laces. the vernis is 100x100x35 mm and will include a charging plug, so i dont need a big box for it.
